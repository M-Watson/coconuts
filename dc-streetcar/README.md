# DC Streetcar folder

The goal is to first use the exploration file to understand the xml pulls for the dc streetcar.
After that, I will make a python commandline application to pull this information.
From the python application experience I will do three things in no particular order.
1) Port the script to JS so it can be embeded in webpages easily
2) Create an alexa skill to obtain streetcar times
3) Create an automated scraper to collect historic data to process over time
