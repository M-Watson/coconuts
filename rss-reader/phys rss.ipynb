Yet other amphibians resisted the epidemic. Based on previous research, scientists at the INDICASAT AIP, Smithsonian and collaborating institutions knew that skin bacteria could be protecting the animals by producing fungi-fighting compounds. However, this time they decided to explore these as potential novel antifungal sources for the benefit of humans and amphibians.\n",

A team of researchers led by the Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics (Albert Einstein Institute; AEI) and the Institute for Gravitational Physics at Leibniz Universität in Hannover, Germany, achieved the breakthrough with a novel experiment. The work ties up with the LISA Pathfinder mission, which tested LISA technologies in space from 2015 to 2017. LISA is a planned observatory in space that will detect gravitational waves inaccessible on Earth. A consortium of international scientists is currently developing LISA as a mission of the European Space Agency (ESA). With their experiment, the AEI scientists demonstrate the functionality of the LISA phasemeter, which will be the central measuring unit of the observatory. Their experiment can also be easily extended for further testing and can thus verify other steps of LISA measurements observatory.\n",

CAPE helps to protect delicate parts during the manufacturing process as well as to avoid any cross-contamination. It also provides a controlled environment in which to sterilize equipment and components. Serving as a \"cleanroom on demand\", CAPE is the ideal solution for any industry needing to keep the production process free of contamination and yet not requiring any permanent sterilized cleanroom facility. Fraunhofer IPA will be showcasing the system at this year's Hannover Messe, April 1 to 5, 2019 (Hall 17, Booth C83).\n",
