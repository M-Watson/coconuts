Drawing on the techniques of \"informed\" machine learning, the system goes far beyond the capabilities of most Alexa, Siri & co. skills – and has been specifically designed for use in industry. The smart vehicle voice assistant is an example of how companies can use dialog systems to enable users to interact intuitively with technology and to develop new busi-ness models.
